# owoifier
a simple shell owoifier for unix-like operating systems!

## installation
```git clone https://github.com/peepee/owoifier && cd owoifier && make install```

now the owoifier is in `/usr/bin` and can be executed from anywhere!

## mac users
if you get the error `cp: /usr/bin/owoifier: Read-only file system`, you must disable system integrity protection for this to work on macos/os x.

you can do this by booting into recovery mode by holding âŒ˜+r after chime, opening a terminal and typing `csrutil disable`, then rebooting.

## usage
at the end of any command, type `| owoifier` to owoify the output!

## uninstallation
idk why you'd EVER want to uninstall this, but you can if you want to.
```make uninstall```
