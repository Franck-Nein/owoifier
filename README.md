# owoifier
a simple shell owoifier

## installation
simply clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/sckwib/owoifier`, move into the newly cloned directory with `cd owoifier` and run the install script as root with `sudo ./install.sh`. if the install script doesn't work, try making it executable with `chmod +x install.sh`
if you're too lazy, just use this automated script:
`git clone https://github.com/sckwib/owoifier && cd owoifier && chmod +x install.sh && sudo ./install.sh`
now the owoifier is in `/usr/bin` and can be executed from anywhere!

## usage
at the end of any command, typing `| owoifier` to owoify the output!
